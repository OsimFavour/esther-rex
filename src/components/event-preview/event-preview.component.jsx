                            30 years ago, God said to me "Gather young ladies and train them to be balanced women in life and ministry"

                            </span>
                            
                            <p>
                                It was a life changing and impactful 40 days. I feel very humbled to see that today, those teenagers and young ladies are mighty women of God doing exploits around the world.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Exactly thirty years after, God has said it's time to rebrand and rebirth. Do it again!

                                It's time to raise global women who are balanced in ministry, motherhood, marriage, money and, managing stress while at it.
                            
                            </p>

                                The best part? Blessed with a professional faculty, I'm not doing it alone.
                                Introducing ESTHER'S WISDOM ACADEMY. Like the school that prepared Esther for the throne in the palace, God is ready to prepare you to impact your world.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                I'm so in awe of what God is set to do for women all over the world. 
                                Fasten your seatbelts, and get on the train. 
                                You have a mandate on your life that must be fulfilled. It's time to get to work!
